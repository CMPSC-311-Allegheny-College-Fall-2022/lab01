# Project 01: Building Ethical and Aggressive Robots

## Final Demo Due: September 29th, 2022 by 2:30pm

## Hardware Guidelines

By working on and completing this laboratory assignment you agree to use the hardware given to
you in a responsible manner. Each team is responsible for the safety and security of the robot
while it is in your possession. You are allowed to take the robots used in this project outside of ALIC but you have to return all parts at the completion of this project.

## Introduction

This project assignment invites you to work in a team to implement an ethical
and/or aggressive robotic behavior while learning how to use `gopigo` robot and
program it using Python programming language with a Raspberry Pi.
This project consists of two portions. First, using the base `gopigo` robot, teams
will participate in the robotic racing competitions during the next lab session.
Secondly, teams will design a robotic application using `gopigo` for community demonstrations.
Teams are also responsible for writing a detailed report,
stored in the file `writing/report.md`. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Learning

To learn about ethical and aggressive robots please read an article titled [Why Ethical Robots Might Not Be Such a Good Idea After All](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/why-ethical-robots-might-not-be-such-a-good-idea-after-all) by Alan Winfield.

To learn about robotics ethics please refer to an article titled
[Robot Ethics: Where Values and Engineering Meet](https://www.automate.org/blogs/robot-ethics-where-values-and-engineering-meet), which provides a lot of additional resources about this subject.

## Instructions

### 1. Robotic Races

We will hold robotic racing challenges during the beginning of the lab on Thursday, September 15th. You will need to build your robot and program it to be able to complete in a spring and box pushing races. You can elect to develop either an ethical (e.g., respectful) or an aggressive (e.g., interfering) robot behavior.

### Starting with the robot

- First, begin charging the battery, located in the little brown box.
- Then, it is time to start building your robot. Follow [gopigo's step-by-step instructions](gopigo.io/start).
- Once your robot is built, you can connect to the robot by following instructions for [pairing gopigo](https://gopigo.io/pairing-gopigo-os/).
**Note:** When you are done using GoPiGo, turn off the robot first. Then, after the robot has shut down completely, turn off the rechargeable battery pack. If you turn off the battery before the robot, you run the risk of corrupting the microSD card.
- Finally, play around with your robot. Try remote control. Then, begin experimenting with programs in Python.

### Race Rules

All robots will begin on the same line. The end line will be marked with tape. Robot positions (left/right) will be determined randomly by the instructor.

1. **Sprint race:** Robots will race along a straight path for three meters until the end line is reached. The robot that reaches the end line _first_ wins.
2. **Pushing race:** Each robot will have a small box right in front of it (front center). The robot needs to push the box along a straight path for three meters
until it pushes the box across the end line. The robot that pushes the small box across the end line _first_ wins.

### 2. Robot Design for Community demonstrations

During the main portion of the project, each team will select a task for the robot to complete and then design and implement a `gopigo` robot to complete that task. This part of the project will be showcased during the community event this semester. Since there are no specific requirements or guidelines for this portion of the project, to ensure fairness in the amount of work you dedicate to this project, each team's selected task (what your robot will do) has to be approved by the instructor. In general, each team either need to propose a unique robot design (e.g., the need to enhance the robot) and a solution for a simple task  or a simple design (e.g., minimal need for robot restructuring) with a solution for a more complex task (e.g., involving multiple sensors). You can explore [project ideas at the gopigo](https://gopigo.io/projects/).

Additionally, since this part of the project will be used as an educational resource to get our local community (think, families with children) excited about computing, each team needs to develop concrete motivation for the educational purposes of your robotic design and development. Article on [Educational Robotics and Robot Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.662030/full)
will give you some background into robotics used for education. Specifically, your project should have:
- Three learning objectives of the proposed demonstration.
- A hands-on component, which will either allow participants to experiment with the robot or observe varying performance of the robot under various scenarios.

You are required to finalize your idea by the end of the lab on September 15th and write about it in an appropriate section of the `report.md`. If you are in need of additional supplies that you could not find in ALIC, you need to include the list of supplies in the appropriate section of the report as well. Instructor will notify you of approval or alternate suggestions within 24 hours.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with  the course instructor during the laboratory
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
